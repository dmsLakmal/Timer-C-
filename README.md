ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am an enthusiastic undergraduate and skilled in coding, 
networking and managing databases. I have strong technical 
skills as well as excellent interpersonal skills, enabling me to 
interact with a wide range of clients. I am eager to be 
challenged in order to grow and further improve my IT skills. 
My greatest passion is in life to work in a competitive 
environment and use my technical know-how to benefit other 
people and organisations.
